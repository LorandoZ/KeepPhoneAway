        "intro":"Sir Isaac Newton FRS PRS was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author (described in his own day as a \"natural philosopher\") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus. "
